Technical Challenge for DevOps  Engineer Role at Pearl.

## Write a Dockerfile for a Computer Vision Application with the 
## following dependencies, that can be run on CPU and GPU.
##

1. python3.6
2. opencv + opencv-contrib
3. numpy
4. scipy
5. cpu
6. gpu

Would you choose to have different Dockerfiles for CPU and GPU versions?  YES

Why? Due to "Put some insane answer here"

Prerequisites:

Dependencies: 
# Python dependencies
RUN pip3 --no-cache-dir install \
    numpy \
    scipy \


Notes:
I pulled most of the examples for CPU and GPU from dockerhub.com
Great examples on dockerhub.com for opencv and opencv-contrib.
This is due to I used to work in the financial and government
industries and they only like "Holy Bless Dockerfiles".

SearchOn:
dockerhub.com
